To run the maproom:

1. Intall conda env ''PRISMaproom''
2. edit config-sample.yaml to have password for iridb user "ingrid" (if you do not have the password ask either Drew or Aaron)
3. run command ''CONFIG=config-sample.yaml python diversity_maproom.py'' in command line

**do not** commit/push updated config-sample.yaml with iridb password as this will then be see by anyone who views the file on github.
